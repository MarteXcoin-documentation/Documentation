MarteXcoin Core
===============

Setup
-----
MarteX Core is the original MarteXcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of MarteXcoin transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download MarteXcoin Core, visit [martexcoin.org](https://martexcoin.org/getstarted.html).

Running

The following are some helpful notes on how to run MarteXcoin Core on your native platform.

### Unix

Unpack the files into a directory and run:
