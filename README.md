MarteXcoin Core
=============

Setup
---------------------
MarteXcoin Core is the original MarteXcoin client and it builds the backbone of the network. It downloads and, by default, stores the entire history of MarteXcoin transactions, which requires a few hundred gigabytes of disk space. Depending on the speed of your computer and network connection, the synchronization process can take anywhere from a few hours to a day or more.

To download MarteXcoin Core, visit [martexcoin.org](https://martexcoin.org/getstarted.html).
