====================
Earning and Spending
====================

MarteX is designed from the ground up to function as digital cash. This
documentation discusses how and where MarteX users can manage all of their
personal finances using MarteX. But at this momment, we do not find a lot 
of services that accepts MarteX.

Earning
=======

A range of services and businesses are available to convert your wage to
and from MarteX as you receive it. It is of course easiest to receive
payment from your employer in MarteX directly, however this may not always
be an option.

Unfortunately, at the moment, we do not know which service 
performs these functions.


Spending
========

Merchant Directory
------------------

MarteX can be spent in hundreds of stores and services both online and in
physical locations. Unfortunately, at the moment, we do not know which service 
performs these functions.

Debit Cards
-----------

Debit cards work by prepaying in MarteX to load the account, then
withdrawing cash from an ATM or spending online or anywhere debit/credit
cards are supported. The MarteX is either exchanged at the time of
purchase or in advance.

The rapidly evolving approach to regulation of cryptocurrencies such as
MarteX and instant exchange solutions such as ShapeShift means that
availability of debit cards cannot be guaranteed in any or all
jurisdictions. Check with the following providers for updates on the
availability of MarteX debit cards.

Tax
===

Taxation law is different depending on where you qualify as a resident
for tax purposes. We do not find any service that exposes taxations laws.
