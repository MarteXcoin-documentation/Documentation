===============
What is MarteX?
===============

MarteX aims to be the most user-friendly and scalable payments-focused
cryptocurrency in the world. The MarteX network features `instant
transaction confirmation <introduction/features.rst>`_, double spend protection,
optional `anonimous <introduction/features.rst>`_ equal to that of physical cash, a
`self-governing, self-funding model <decentralized-governance>`_ 
driven by `incentivized full nodes <masternode-network>`_ and a 
`clear roadmap <https://martexcoin.org>`_ for on-chain scaling to
up to 400MB blocks using custom-developed open source hardware. While
MarteX is based on Bitcoin and compatible with many key components of the
Bitcoin ecosystem, its two-tier network structure offers significant
improvements in transaction speed, anonimaty and governance. This section
of the documentation describes these and many more key features that set
MarteX apart in the blockchain economy.
