How To Buy
==========

MarteX can be purchased and sold in several ways, each with different
advantages and disadvantages. The following options are available:

- `Exchanges <./how-to-buy.rst#exchanges>`_ are one of the most popular ways to trade
  cryptocurrency. A wide range of exchanges exist, each offering 
  slightly different features. Some serve different markets, some are in
  direct competition, some have cheaper fees, and some are subject to
  more or less strict regulatory requirements. Most exchanges are 
  centralized, meaning they are operated by a single company, which may
  be obliged by the laws of the jurisdiction in which it operates to 
  collect data on its customers. Others are decentralized, but as a 
  result have higher escrow requirements since you are dealing 
  peer-to-peer instead of with a trusted entity. Exchanges can be 
  broadly broken down into two categories: exchanges which accept 
  national currency (fiat money) and exchanges which deal in 
  cryptocurrencies only. For safety, exchanges should not be used as 
  wallets. Exchanges are for trading, not for savings.

- `Instant exchanges <./how-to-buy.rst#instant-exchanges>`_ perform a similar
  function to normal exchanges, but without the requirement to log in.
  They effectively convert one currency to another, with some limits on
  the amount to be exchanged and usually at a less advantageous rate.
  Others may even offer to sell cryptocurrency as a credit card
  purchase.

- `Over the counter <./how-to-buy.rst#over-the-counter>`_ exchanges have recently 
  appeared to facilitate sale of MarteX directly from a company to the 
  individual at a specified price, or peer-to-peer between individuals 
  at a negotiated price. Volume may be limited compared to exchanges, 
  but these services are usually much easier to use. More advanced 
  peer-to-peer sites offer escrow services for a fee to prevent cheating
  during the sale between two parties who have never met.

- `ATMs <./how-to-buy.rst#atms>`_ accepting card and cash payments in return for
  crypto are widely available. Mapping services can show the specific
  location of these machines, or you can even set one up at your own 
  business and earn a percentage of sales.

.. _exchanges:

Exchanges
=========

Cryptocurrency exchanges exist to convert national currency, also known
as fiat money, into cryptocurrency. Many exchanges do not accept fiat
money, and exchange between various cryptocurrencies only. Trades are
handled on markets, and trades are created between pairs of currencies,
identified by their ticker codes. Dash is widely accepted on exchanges
and many pairs exist against both fiat money and cryptocurrency. This
means it is possible to exchange EUR for MARTEX, or MARTEX for BTC, for
example. The volume traded on an exchange provides a good indication of
how quickly a buy or sell order you place will be filled. This section
introduces some of the most popular exchanges for trading Dash.
